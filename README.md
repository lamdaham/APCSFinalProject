Brief Description:
Our goal is to create a project that resembles SoulKnight, a dungeon-based game. The player would be able to control his/her motions using either the WASD or arrow keys to defeat monsters to get through the dungeon which would comprise numerous rooms that increase in difficulty as the player progresses. The health of both the player and the monsters would be displayed and would decrease accordingly with each attack. Loot would also be found in certain rooms within the dungeon and could range from items to buffs or debuffs depending on the playerâ€™s luck. Only when all monsters in that particular room are cleared would the next room become available and the game would only end when either the player loses full health or the boss is defeated.
