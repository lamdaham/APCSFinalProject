Brief Description:
Our goal is to create a project that resembles SoulKnight, a dungeon-based game, but with a circus theme where the player is meant to be a panda fighting against the clowns in order to free the other circus animals. The player would be able to control his/her motions using the WASD keys to defeat the monsters to get through the dungeon. The dungeon comprises numerous levels that only increase in difficulty: the monsters’ speed along with attack power and other obstacles. Attacks will accordingly decrease the character’s health and at the end of each level, the player would be able to get either a debuff or a buff or even a new type of gun. Only when all monsters in that particular level are cleared would the next level become available and the game would end when the player loses full health, resulting in the game over screen, or if the boss is defeated.
